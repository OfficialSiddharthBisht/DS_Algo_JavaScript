Queues are linear data structures, where data is stored and operated as per FIFO method, where FIFO stands for First in First out or Last In Last Out LILO.

FIFO method focusses on retrieving the oldest data that has been put into the queue.

The point at which data is inserted into the queue is called REAR.

The point from which data is removed from the queue is called FRONT.

Basic operations associated with queues :

1. Enqueue() - Adding data at the REAR of queue .
2. Dequeue() - Removing data from the FRONT of queue.

If the queue is full then no element can be enqueued further. This condition is called "Overflow"

If the queue is empty then no element can be dequeued. This condition is called "Underflow".

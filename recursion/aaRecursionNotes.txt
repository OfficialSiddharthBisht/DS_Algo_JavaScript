Notes : -
Function : A block of code which have some specific name and whenever that name is called the block of code executes.

Recursive Function - Simple Defination - A function that calls itself or A problem that is defined in terms of itself .

Iterative Function - All the functions which are not Recursive are Iterative functions.

Base Condition - A condition which when not present then our program can lead us to infinity . Also know as terminating condition . The ultimate goal of our Recursive function is to reach to the base condition.

State Of A Function - 
Suppose we have a function -

function sum(a,b){
    return a+b;
}

sum(3,8);   // returns 11
sum(10,20); // returns 30

Although the instructions that will we performed in both the function are same but the data on which the instructions are performed are different.
Therefore the state of the function is dependent on the data on which the operations are performed.
